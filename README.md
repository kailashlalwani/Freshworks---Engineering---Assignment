# Freshworks---Engineering---Assignment


Build a file-based Key-Value data Store that supports the basic CRD (create, read, and delete) operations. This data store is meant to be used as a local storage for one single process on one laptop. The data store must be exposed as a library to clients that can instantiate a class and work
with the data store. The data store will support the following functional requirements

# Languages:
Ideally, we would not restrict you from working on a language of your choice. However, it would be preferable if you stick with one of these -
• NodeJS
• Java
• Python
• GoLang
• Ruby
• C/C++
# Submission:
Submit a link to the source code, ideally committed to Github.
Code accompanied by thorough unit tests is typically a mark of quality work.
Ideally, your data store will work on most operating systems. If this is not the case, please specify which OSes are supported.
